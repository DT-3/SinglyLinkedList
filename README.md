# SinglyLinkedList
A SSL in C++

The main method runs all methods that are located in the header file. I made
this for a school assignment and have plans to make a Java version in the future. 
This is a singly linked list that is based off a node based system. Each node contains
a pointer to the next node and each node stores its data as an int. In the future this
can be templatetized and probably should be for optimal performance. The only reason that
every method is NOT O(1) is because the assingment needed some extra fluff methods like the
Display() method.
